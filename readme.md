Run QEMU hardware-accelerated graphics on headless Debian hosts without installing an Xorg server or desktop environment.

`qemu-render` provides the host-side Mesa and virglrenderer runtime used by QEMU for OpenGL, Vulkan/Venus, and native DRM contexts. It keeps hardware-accelerated EGL/GBM rendering, hardware Vulkan, VirGL/Venus, and AMDGPU/i915 native-context support available on servers, containers, and appliance-style systems while leaving out runtime components that are unnecessary for this use case.

## Features ✨

- Designed for headless Debian hosts with no Xorg server or desktop environment
- Hardware-accelerated EGL and GBM rendering through Mesa on Intel and AMD GPUs
- Supports the Mesa `crocus`, `iris`, `r600`, and `radeonsi` Gallium drivers
- Hardware Vulkan through Mesa ANV and HasVK on Intel GPUs and RADV/ACO on AMD GPUs
- Custom virglrenderer with VirGL, Venus, and `virgl_render_server` support
- Native DRM context support for AMDGPU and Intel i915
- QXL support through a reduced SPICE server runtime for QEMU's VNC display path

## Package design 📦

The package version-provides:

```text
libgbm1
libegl-mesa0
libspice-server1
libvirglrenderer1
```

It also provides the virtual `vulkan-icd` package and conflicts with/replaces Debian's `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, because `qemu-render` ships its own Intel and AMD Vulkan ICDs. It conflicts with/replaces `virgl-server` for the same reason around `virgl_render_server`. On a headless host, this lets Debian's official QEMU modules satisfy their normal runtime dependencies without installing the broader stock Mesa Gallium/Vulkan/LLVM and SPICE multimedia runtime stacks.

## Mesa runtime 🎨

The Mesa portion contains:

- `crocus` for older Intel generations supported by Gallium Crocus
- `iris` for newer Intel GPUs
- `r600` for older AMD Radeon GPUs based on TeraScale
- `radeonsi` for newer AMD Radeon GPUs based on GCN and RDNA
- ANV for newer Intel Vulkan-capable GPUs
- HasVK for older Intel Vulkan-capable GPUs
- RADV with ACO for AMD Vulkan-capable GPUs
- EGL and GBM for headless rendering

Mesa's legacy `i915` Gallium driver is not included because it requires LLVM in the final runtime. Intel 915/945/G33/Q33/Q35/Pineview GPUs (for example GMA 900, 950, 3100, and 3150) that require this driver are therefore not supported. This does not affect virglrenderer's separate Intel `i915-experimental` native DRM context backend.

The Vulkan build contains only the Intel and AMD hardware ICDs needed for this project; Lavapipe and optional Vulkan layers are not included. Intel ray tracing is disabled to avoid the separate Intel CLC/ray-tracing compiler path. Debian's small `libvulkan1` loader is used at runtime.

LLVM is available only while compiling Mesa build-time tools. The final OpenGL and Vulkan runtime is built with both `-Dllvm=disabled` and `-Damd-use-llvm=false`, and the finished package is verified to contain no direct or transitive LLVM runtime dependency.

## VirGL and Venus runtime 🎮

The virglrenderer portion provides `libvirglrenderer.so.1` for QEMU's normal VirGL path and also builds Venus support together with `virgl_render_server`.

It additionally enables the AMDGPU and Intel i915 native DRM renderers, allowing QEMU to expose native DRM contexts to compatible Linux guests.

The renderer is built with:

```text
-Dplatforms=egl
-Dvenus=true
-Ddrm-renderers=amdgpu-experimental,i915-experimental
-Drender-server-worker=thread
-Dunstable-apis=true
-Dtests=false
-Dvideo=false
```

The `thread` worker setting applies to the external render-server path used by Venus; it does not change QEMU's normal in-process VirGL renderer. Thread workers are used so all Venus contexts in the render-server process share the device-memory budget accounting.

The native-context backends use virglrenderer's upstream `amdgpu-experimental` and `i915-experimental` renderer options.
